# Instructions  

## Overall Tic Tac Toe Steps

Working on the first 3 steps today:

1. **Ask for position to play**
2. **Check that position is valid**
3. **Place X or O in that position**
4. Check for winner
5. Switch to next player's turn
6. Repeat until someone wins, or the board is full

## Starter Code

Same code from last class - greeting the player

Plus:
* 9 variables for the positions on the board
* An f-string to print out the board with the variables

## Your Task

Follow the TODOs in the code:

1. Check the position is valid
2. Update the correct variable based on the position entered

## Hint

* To get the first character from a string, use `string[0]`. To get the other characters, use `string[1]`, `string[2]`, `string[3]` etc.
* To check if a string is a number, you can use `string.isnumeric()`
* Remember that you can combine conditions using `and` and `or`
